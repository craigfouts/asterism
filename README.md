# Project Hot Topic
Implementations of semantic segmentation algorithms and spatial topic models applied to point cloud data. Current methods include variations of latent Dirichlet allocation, a neural clustering process, and a discrete variational autoencoder. Also a test bed for PriorLDA, a nonparametric topic model with encoded spatial priors.
